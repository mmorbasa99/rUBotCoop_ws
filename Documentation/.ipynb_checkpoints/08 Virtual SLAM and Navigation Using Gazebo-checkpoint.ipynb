    "To test this sensor, it is better to use a Python script that makes the robot wander in the environment while avoiding the obstacles. To do this, we have implemented the following rules in our script: \n",
    "- If there is no obstacle, move forward at a reference speed of 0.8 m/s. \n",
    "- If the range provided by the distance sensor is lower than 2 meters, go back and rotate counter-clockwise until avoiding the obstacle. \n",
    "- Since the distance sensor throws unidirectional measurements, we should check the measurements from the LDS to find if there are obstacles to the sides, and the threshold should be lower than 1.6 meters. If obstacles are detected, go back and rotate counter-clockwise faster to avoid the obstacle and not get stuck on it.\n",
